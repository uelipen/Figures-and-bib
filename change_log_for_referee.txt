1. In Section II, we update Eq.(4) to emphasize that $k^\mu$ is a function of the asymptotic frequency and the radial coordinate. Thus the logic is more obvious when we later use it.

2. In Section III, we added more explicit definition of our variables, and updated Figure 1 and its caption to better represent their role in the geometry.

Note to Darsh: Please update the Figure.

3. In Section III, we corrected a typo if subscript in Eq.(8). It correctly represents the frequencies seen on earth now.

4. In Section IV, we update the Figure for a more accurate definition of $r_p$ and $r_e$.

Note to Darsh: Please update the Figure.

5. Through out the paper, we remove superfluous equation numbers.

6. We split Sec.V into two subsections. The first subsection describes the strength and shape of our effect as measured by the change in time-of-arrival of pulsar’s signal. The second subsection discusses how likely to have a good candidate for our effect to happen and be observed.

7. In Sec.V.A, We enhance the connection of this subsection both to the previous one where we derived our results, and to Figure 4 where we present a few examples for difference values of $\theta$.
